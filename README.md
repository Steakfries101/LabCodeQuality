After comparing all the checklists and different points made by each article, it's hard to not see commonalities and universal rules emerge. Almost every article spoke about code being bug-free and usable in some way or another.
Another very important part is the testability. If code is unable to be tested, it will essentially be impossible to build upon. Testing code is incredibly important and when done wrong can cause such headaches. Another big one is consistency,
almost every article mentioned it in one way or another. Consistency is important because it helps with readability and usability and come to think of it almost everything else as well. If code isn't consistent then it can make things much harder for someone who isn't the original programmer etc. The last point I'd like to talk about is code clarity. Code clarity is one of the most important things to pay attention to when coding. Clear code means it's easy to read and understand. It allows other programmers to work on it easily as well as makes it easy for the original programmer to troubleshoot etc. When code is clean and straightforward there is way less room for error, when things get to convoluted that's when stuff starts to fall apart.
